== Welcome to Stumppuller Rails 3

This Rails application is largely a learning opportunity for me to get familiar with the new Rails3 framework.

Stumppuller is intended to provide a web based virtual dyno for engine builders and enthusiasts, but will start with smaller calculators, and graphs where appropriate.

This Rails3 application is intended to operate as a public facing front end for the node.js backend API I intend to build to do the calculations for Stumppuller.

The node.js backend is intended to accept and return json strings, the rails frontend will prepare the visual presentation, any database storage, and potentially any community oriented services.

== Getting Started

In order to build this application using Rails 3 pre-release I had to do some extra gymnastics, guided by http://oscardelben.com/install-rails-3

My build environment was using Ruby Enterprise Edition 2010.02 1.8.7 on Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid

    sudo gem install tzinfo builder memcache-client rack rack-test erubis mail text-format bundler thor i18n
    sudo gem install rack-mount --version=0.4.0
    sudo gem install rails --pre
    rails -v
    rails new stumppuller_rails3

== Installing Rspec

I like rspec there is a new version of http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails  which can be easily incorporated via the Gemfile

    group :development, :test do
      gem "rspec-rails", ">= 2.0.0.beta.17"
    end

Then ran

  rails generate rspec:install

== Installing sqlite3-ruby (1.3.1) with native extensions

When attempting to install the sqlite-gem there was a compile error.

    # gem install sqlite3-ruby
    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
    ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3-ruby:
            ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
    sqlite3-ruby only supports sqlite3 versions 3.6.16+, please upgrade!

I had an older sqlite version

    # sqlite -version
    2.8.17

I issued the following

    cd /usr/local/src
    wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz
    cd sqlite-3.7.0
    ./configure
    make
    make install

uncommented the following in the Gemfile

    gem "sqlite3-ruby", :require => "sqlite3"

then

    bundle update
